                <h2>Engineering - a way of life</h2>
                <!-- Include your blog content here -->
                <p>Honestly, everyone is an engineer.

                    Engineering is defined as “designing and building something using scientific principles.”
                    
                    Designing and building begin as early as our birth and last until our death. You design your decision and build a life for yourselves.
                    
                    Cooking involves designing in your head the final appetizing food you want to consume, and you then build the food systematically through scientific principles of thermodynamics, chemical reactions, and culinary science.
                    
                    You design a song and build a melody, you design art and build a painting, you design a path and build a journey. Now it does seem like all the profession is nothing but engineering albeit given a different name.
                    
                    Now more than ever, technology produced by engineers has become part of our everyday lives- well can you be at peace without lights and internet for more than 48 hours? Sure some can, but most can’t. Even thinking if you can or cannot do something (you are right both the time) it is engineering your belief system.</p>

                    <br><img href="images/pic01.jpg"><br>
                    Your habits are the result of what values and beliefs you have engineered throughout your lives. Building new habits involve designing the outcomes, processes, and systems and keeping the motivation (which can be considered as the oil that helps run the machine).

Treating your life and its aspects as engineering systems can help greatly master your purpose and feelings. In lean engineering, you tend to eliminate unnecessary processes and components to reduce efforts and costs. In the same way, negative feelings, hatred, and self-deprecating activities should be eliminated quickly. To think like an engineer, you don’t need a 4-year degree-all you need is passion and love for living the best lives.
