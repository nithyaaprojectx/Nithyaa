<b>Airbnb-</b>The founders of Airbnb experienced frustration when they struggled to pay rent in San Francisco. They decided to rent out air mattresses in their apartment to attendees of a design conference, seeing an opportunity due to hotels being fully booked. This frustration with expensive lodging options led to the creation of Airbnb, now a global online marketplace for lodging and travel experiences.                    
<br><br><b>Slack-</b> Before creating Slack, Stewart Butterfield was frustrated while working on a gaming project that didn't pan out. In the process, he and his team developed an internal messaging system to communicate more effectively. Recognizing the potential of this tool to solve communication issues in other workplaces, they pivoted, leading to the birth of Slack, a widely-used team collaboration platform.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Whatsapp-</b> The frustration of missing out on important phone calls due to their inability to afford expensive international calling rates led Jan Koum and Brian Acton to create WhatsApp. This messaging app allowed users to send messages over the internet rather than through traditional SMS, addressing their frustration with costly communication methods. WhatsApp later became one of the most popular messaging apps globally.
               
               <br> <br>    <b>Tesla-</b>Elon Musk, while frustrated with the slow progress of electric vehicle development, decided to take matters into his own hands. He co-founded Tesla with the aim of accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy. Musk's frustration with the lack of innovation in the automotive industry propelled him to create a successful line of electric cars and push the boundaries of renewable energy technology.

               <b>Spanx-</b>Sara Blakely faced frustration when she couldn't find suitable undergarments to wear under white pants. Unhappy with existing options, she designed her own solution using hosiery and thus created Spanx. Her frustration with the lack of comfortable and effective shapewear led her to build a billion-dollar company that revolutionized the undergarment industry.

                There are many a case studies taht prove this hypothesis of mine- Some kind of frustration leads to success.
                <br><br> So what are you frustrated about today? Maybe the solution you come up with, might change the course of humanity forever.
                <br><br>I am frustrated about no community robots. I might come up with a solution soon.
